The Industrial Revolution was a period of major industrialization that took place during the late 1700s and early 1800s. It began in Great Britain and quickly spread to other parts of the world.

This era was characterized by the development of machines, factories, and mass production. It led to significant social, economic, and cultural changes. Key innovations included the steam engine, spinning jenny, and power loom.

Urbanization increased as people moved to cities in search of work, and new transportation systems like railways and canals emerged.
